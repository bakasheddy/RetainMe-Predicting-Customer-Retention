# Key finding

> Age is the most importannt feaauture to determine churn possibility, middle age group churn the most from all other age groups, there could be several reasons why this happens

- Career Plateau: Middle-aged employees may have been with the organization for a while and may have reached a plateau in their careers. They may feel like they have hit a ceiling in terms of opportunities for advancement, and may become bored or disillusioned with their work.

- Family Responsibilities: Middle-aged employees may be juggling significant family responsibilities, such as caring for children or aging parents. These responsibilities can be challenging to balance with work demands, and may make them more likely to leave an organization if they feel that their work is interfering with their personal life.

- Health Issues: Middle-aged employees may be more prone to health issues that can affect their ability to work. For example, they may develop chronic health conditions that make it difficult to maintain a full-time job. If their employer is not able to provide the necessary support, such as flexible work arrangements or accommodations, they may choose to leave the organization.

- Generational Differences: Middle-aged employees may feel like they don't fit in with the younger or older generations of employees in the organization. This can create feelings of isolation or disconnection, and may lead them to seek employment elsewhere.

- Lack of Job Satisfaction: Middle-aged employees may have higher expectations for job satisfaction and fulfillment, and may be less willing to tolerate a job that doesn't meet those expectations. If they feel like their work is not meaningful or fulfilling, they may be more likely to leave the organization.

> Another important feature to determine churn possibility is salary and it is discovered that most of the customers earn low salaries and have low balance in their account. people with low salary will churn the most in other to meet ends need
